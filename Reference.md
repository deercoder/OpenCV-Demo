3. How to use NDK(or support JNI) in Android Studio:
     should install the ndk plugin(now by default android studio provide this option to download).
     However, still need to configure the `gradle`, otherwise there are strange errors even though we have get the correct .c and .h files as well as interface in .java files.
     In order to update gradle we need the newest android studio(v2.1), then follows some steps to configurate(upgrading to v2.1 requires ~2.1G downloads and stand-by installing as it takes too much resources)
